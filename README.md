🌀 Diffusion Models from Scratch with PyTorch

This project is a step-by-step implementation of a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) using PyTorch. It walks through the full training pipeline—from data loading and noise scheduling to building a simplified U-Net, training the model, and generating new images from pure noise.

📖 Features:
* 🚀 Uses CUDA for fast GPU-accelerated training
* 🖼️ Trains on the CIFAR-10 image dataset
* 🔁 Implements forward and reverse diffusion processes
* 🧠 Builds and trains a simple U-Net to denoise images
* 🎨 Generates new images by reversing the diffusion steps
* 👁️ Visualizes intermediate denoising steps
